******* INHERITANCE *******
Inheritance : Child Class can Acquire All properties and Methods from Parent Class.
it helps to code reusability
Parent class can also be called 
i) Super Class
ii) Base Class

Child Class can also  be called
i) Sub Class
ii) Derived Class

Example:

cat,dog,cow these all are living organisms called Animals 

So Animal is the parent Class And cat,dog,cow ,etc all are child classes

inheritance Structure: 


 class Animal{                                          ----> Class is Keyword to declare Class and Animal is Class Name

void sound(){                                           ----> void is no return type and sound is the Method with no return type

System.out.println("Animals can make sound: ");        ----> this is the print statement
}
}
class Cat extends Animal{                              -----> here cat can be derived as subclass from animal class using Extends Keyword.
                                                       ----> Extends Keyword is used to inherit the child class from parent class

void sound(){                                         -->  sound is an parent (Super) method thats overriding child class (Derived class)
System.out.println("Cat can Sound like meow");
}
